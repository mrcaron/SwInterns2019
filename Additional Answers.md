* I say "Agile", you think...
    * Agile development, a flexible, iterative approach to large scale projects
* I say "DevOps", you think...
    * A fast paced development process integrating software development and operations teams to minimize software delivery time and 
      adapt to changing markets and customer demands
* I say "C++", you think...
    * A fast, fairly lightweight language with a combination of object oriented programming, speed, and efficiency.
* I say "Internship", you think...
    * A great opportunity to get hands on experience with real world projects and deal with the challenges of working
      with large code bases and tight time constraints. Answers may be hard to find at first compared to "sanitized" school projects.
* What are some programming pet peeves you have?
    * I have some programming pet peeves with obscure and/or clunky code, inelegant code, or overly complicated code,
      since it becomes a nightmare to debug and maintain later on.
* Tell us about the people who've influenced your programming.
    * My father, a long time senior member of SolidWorks, who taught me important axioms such as "Always check to see whether
      pointers are NULL before you use them" and "Initialize everything to something reasonable first". Professor Alex Thornton,
      a great professor of computer science at UCI, who taught me Python and C++ in a detailed, thorough manner, and always 
      coded clean and professional class for me to see every lecture. https://www.ics.uci.edu/~thornton/
* Tell us why you think you'd make an awesome addition to our team.
    * I adapt to new situations very quickly and create working solutions to complex problems such as making a custom memory allocator
      in C within a short amount of time. I am very motivated to learn about real world appliations and development processes and 
      I can get along with just about anyone on a team. I have done pair programming with numerous partners and set aside my differences
      with them to produce robust code that works in almost all test cases, including edge cases. When alone, I can optimize and produce
      even better code that handles errors gracefully and does not crash. I am familiar with agile development and Scrum and work on
      my code in an iterative manner, fixing bugs on the fly and adjusting when needed.
