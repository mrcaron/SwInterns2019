	 Hearing “Agile” I think agile methodologies being applied to software development. When creating a software or developing a code base, doing it in an “Agile” way tells that a team/s start with a methodology to work upon, planning at each stage of the development line, being flexible to changes and user requests. When these are proved to be efficient, others teams can follow a similar approach, thus enabling the entire organization/ company to achieve its goals in a more systematic way.  Some of the proven practices can be used based on the type of product they are dealing with.

	DevOps- Development Operations is more like a  series of developments which are made by different teams and combining/ deploying them to make the final product. Each successful task is pushed to pipeline which is managed by a tool which combines them and makes it ready for production. Managing teams, collaborating work, providing end to end solutions for a business goal are all the part of DevOps.

	 C++: The first thing I think about C++ and its object oriented language.  Also its provides low level memory management, with various methods, classes, supporting wide range of functionalities. It’s more like a general purpose programming language. Java and C++ both have many common features and C++ is much faster than JAVA , when it comes to number of system calls it makes, and instruction count.

	 Internship: when I hear this, to be honest I get goosebumps. I think it’s a golden opportunity for students to start their professional career in the fields they have chosen. You’ll get to know how corporate life looks like, how to make use of the skills that you have learnt. Even for the companies, they can look into the students caliber and decide whether he/she is a good fit.

	Using spaces over tabs, and poorly named variables are my top programming pet peeves. Some others include: not closing file handles, long functions which can be divide into sub functions, indentation, etc,.

	I started coding from class 8 and it has been a wonderful experience till now solving problems, making things better. My programming was highly influenced by my computer science teacher Ms. Shashikala Madam. She was the one who taught me what is programming, how to write a program. Initially I was finding it very difficult to catch up things and I almost felt this is not my area. Due to mandatory exams, I had to study somehow, so went to her asking doubts. She thought me in such simple words and made it so interesting that made me feel I am making things faster(my addition of two numbers program). That day (which I still remember) I studied this subject with interest, and there came all the doubts at each and every topic. She not only made me good at programming, she gave me an insight on how to approach to any problem, say math, physics. I am grateful that she was teacher. I take this opportunity to Thank her once again.

	 Being an awesome addition to a team needs to have some of the qualities such as working in teams, apply the knowledge you have and learn quick, easily switch between different tasks assigned, meet deadlines with well documented reports, etc. I strongly believe that I have all these to the maximum, as I have experienced each of these in my group projects, personal projects, research paper reviewing, and I have always got good feedbacks/results till now. 
    1. The one thing that I am proud to say Is the I am quick learner, which gives me an edge and I’ll never leave a topic unattended till I know the depth of it. 
    2. Although, it is possible for you to think that i have no professional experience and why should we hire him. Being a fresh graduate has increased my desperateness to work at a company to the next level. I am very confident about my soft skills, and waiting for an opportunity to leverage my skills.
    3. SolidWorks is all about bringing technology to the real world to make things easy and efficient. Being a CS graduate these are the things I am passionate about from day one. 
    4. My strong technical skills, team player, and quick learner makes me a good fit for the software development team.
