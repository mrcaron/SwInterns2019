Choose Your Own Adventure:

1. Check if a String is a palindrome or not

    The program is in the file Palindrome.java. This can be displayed as a command line program where the user adds the word
    to check as an argument. The program will print true or false as the result.

2. Split a string into parts based off a given character

    The program is in the file SplitString.java. This can also be displayed as a command line program where the user adds the string
    to split and the character as arguments. The program will print the split parts in different lines, or just the string
    if the character to split with did not exist in the string.
    
3. Find the 5th character of a string that has length > 5

    The program is in the file FindFifth.java. This can also be displayed as a command line program where the user adds the string
    as an argument. The program can either print the fifth character or none if the string provided is null or has length > 5.
    
4. Reverse a string

    The program is in the file Reverse.java. This can be displayed as a command line program where the user adds the string
    to be reversed as an argument. The program will print the reversed string.
    
5. Write code to crash your program

    The program is in the file Crash.java. The program can be run using the command line without any arguments and will
    eventually crash.
    
Programs 1 to 4 can also be made into webpages where the user writes the required input in text fields and the output
